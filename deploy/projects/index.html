      <h1>Team Memory Leak Website</h1>
      <h2>About: </h2>
      <p>
        This is a project I am currently working on (12/21/2024) with friends as a student at UCR. 
        The particular friends are Luis Alonfo Bojorquez and Jacob Kantor at the moment. 
        I hope to add more friends to this project and for this project to long live past our student years. 
        We are currently planning the project using Figma, Kanban, and Scrum Meetings.

      <h1>CS100 Group Project</h1>
      <h2>About: </h2>
      <p>
        This project was done in less than 10 weeks with the initial 4-6 weeks of planning and learning.
        It was aimed to be an RPG Game where you would wander the map and battle enemies.
        I had done the project with 3 other members, one of them a friend, Luis Bojorquez. While each member,
        had a week each to be scrum master, I took majority of the leadership as I was the most flexible
        in terms of schedule and planning while also knowing the most of the direction we took the project..
